# Third-party notices

`Model.js`, and the parts of `BarWidget.qml` and `Panel.qml` that are not
about calendar events, are Omarchy's stock clock plugin
(`$OMARCHY_PATH/shell/plugins/panels/clock`, Omarchy 4.0.0.alpha), MIT
licensed. The first commit of this repository is that plugin, unchanged, so
`git diff <first commit>` shows exactly what this plugin adds.

`Model.js` is kept byte-for-byte stock. OmaCal's own logic lives in
`Calendar.js` and `backends/`.
